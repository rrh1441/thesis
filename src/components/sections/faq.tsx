    question: 'Is Thesis a real brokerage?',
    answer:
      'Today, Thesis is a paper-trading sandbox. You can simulate positions, track P/L, and share ideas without executing real trades. Live brokerage integrations are on the roadmap.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which markets are supported?',
    answer:
      'The MVP focuses on US equities and ETFs. The AI model may reference other assets, but live quote coverage relies on Polygon or Finnhub for equities.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How reliable are the AI outputs?',
    answer:
      'We use OpenAIâ€™s structured JSON mode with temperature controls and validation to reduce hallucinations. Always treat outputs as research starting points, not investment advice.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I export or share my theses?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Saved theses appear in your dashboard and the community feed. Social sharing cards are planned for the next release.',
